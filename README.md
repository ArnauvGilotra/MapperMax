# MapperMax: Your Intelligent University Guide

Welcome to the repository for MapperMax, an advanced mapping tool built specifically for university students. Leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5, MapperMax helps to plan and optimize routes for multiple stops (akin to solving the Travelling Salesman Problem), providing students with the best and fastest paths across campus.

## Features

* **Innovative UI/UX:** Our user interface is built on top of the versatile GTK library, offering seamless interaction for the end-users. It's not just us boasting about it â€“ the UI/UX was applauded as the best by professors and teaching assistants this year.

* **Pathfinding with Dijkstra:** We employ Dijkstra's algorithm to handle pathfinding, ensuring optimal routes are found quickly and effectively.

* **Graphics with EZGL:** MapperMax utilizes the powerful EZGL graphics library to vividly render roads, buildings, highways, rivers, and oceans on the map canvas.

* **Superb Responsiveness:** MapperMax offers a highly responsive map experience. With smooth panning and zooming capabilities, navigating your university has never been so easy and efficient.
